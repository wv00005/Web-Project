# Web-Project

This is the web project for Intro to Web DEvelopement made by William Vanderboom. This is a website that is made to be like a artist showcase website for some artworks I have done. For the purposes of this project I am acting like an artist but am not actually one. However, all of the artworks displayed were painted or sculpted by me.
